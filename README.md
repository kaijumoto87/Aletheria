# Aletheria

**Aletheria** is a terminal-based RPG prototype written in Python.  
It is being developed as a learning project focused on game systems, combat logic, progression, and state management.

The project currently exists as a text-based prototype and is intended to evolve over time as features and systems are expanded.

## 📜 Naming & Theme

The name Aletheria is derived from the Greek word ἀλήθεια (aletheia), meaning truth, disclosure, or unconcealment.
This concept is intended to influence future narrative and world-building elements.

## 🧠 Project Purpose

This project was created as a **hands-on learning exercise** to improve understanding of:

- Python programming
- Control flow and game loops
- State management
- Data structures
- Randomization and probability
- Iterative development and refactoring

Development progress is tracked over time to reflect learning and improvement rather than a finished product.
