# Aletheria

**Aletheria** is a terminal-based RPG prototype written in Python.  
<<<<<<< HEAD
It is being developed as a learning project focused on game systems, combat logic,
progression, and state management.

The project currently exists as a text-based prototype and is intended to evolve
over time as features and systems are expanded.
